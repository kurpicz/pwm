# Huffman-shaped Wavelet Trees and Wavelet Matrices

Here, we extended our algorithms such that their output is a Huffman-shaped wavelet tree (HWT) or Huffman-shaped wavelet matrix (HWM).
To this end, we compute the Huffman codes for all symbols in our input and compute the bit vectors for the codes.
Hence, the size of the levels of the tree/matrix will be decreasing.
The first level of a HWT/HWM contains the exactly as many bits as the first level of a WT/WM.

We have implemented:
1. TODO

Replace _wx_ with either _hwt_ or _hwm_ for the corresponding HWT- or HWM-construction algorithm.
